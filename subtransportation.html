        <p>Trains in this city are very sophisticated and have many categories.
          The officers in this city are very punctual,
          there are so many types of trains in this city,
          You should try Shinkasen which is the fastest train in this city </p>
         <p>Tokyo is covered by a dense network of train, subway and bus lines, 
             which are operated by about a dozen different companies. 
             The train lines operated by JR East and the subway lines are 
             most convenient for moving around central Tokyo. </p>
         <p>Tokyo's most prominent train line is the JR Yamanote Line, 
            a loop line which connects Tokyo's multiple city centers. 
            The city's 13 subway lines are operated by two companies and run 
            largely inside the Yamanote circle and the areas around Ginza and 
            the area east of the loop line. Most of the many suburban train 
            lines commence at one of the six major stations 
            of the Yamanote Line (Tokyo, Ueno, Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Shibuya and Shinagawa).</p>
