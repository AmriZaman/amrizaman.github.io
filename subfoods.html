        <p> Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯ̥ɕiꜜ] or [sɯ̥ꜜɕi]) is
          a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi),
          usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients
          (ネタ neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.
          Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely,
          but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also
          referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).  </p>
        <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice,
           though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
            It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail,
            salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian.
            It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce.
            Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
            Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine
            that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat,
            and an optional serving of rice. </p>
         <p>The common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared sushi rice.
          Fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation vary widely.
          Due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is spelled with zu instead
          of su when a prefix is attached, as in nigirizushi.
          Chirashizushi (ちらし寿司, "scattered sushi", also referred to as barazushi)
          serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes.
          It is commonly eaten because it is filling,
          fast and easy to make. It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March.</p>
