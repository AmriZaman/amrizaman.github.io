Inarizushi (稲荷寿司) is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone.
Tales tell that inarizushi is named after the Shinto god Inari.
Foxes, messengers of Inari, are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu,
and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears.
Regional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (帛紗寿司, fukusa-zushi,
or 茶巾寿司, chakin-zushi) instead of tofu. It should not be confused with inari maki,
which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu. In Korean,
inarizushi called yubuchobap (유부초밥).
Cone sushi is a variant of inarizushi originating in Hawaii that may
include green beans, carrots, or gobo along with rice, wrapped in
a triangular abura-age piece. It is often sold in okazu-ya (Japanese delis)
and as a component of bento boxes
