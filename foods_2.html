        <h4>Sushi</h4>
        <p> Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯ̥ɕiꜜ] or [sɯ̥ꜜɕi]) is
          a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi),
          usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients
          (ネタ neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.
          Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely,
          but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also
          referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).  </p>

        <h4>Okonamiyaki</h4>
         <p>Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き o-konomi-yaki) is a Japanese savory pancake
          containing a variety of ingredients in a wheat-flour-based batter;
          it is an example of Konamon (flour-based Japanese cuisine).
          The name is derived from the word okonomi,
          meaning "how you like" or "what you like", and yaki meaning
          "cooked" (usually fried). Okonomiyaki is mainly associated
          with the Kansai or Hiroshima areas of Japan, but is widely
          available throughout the country. Toppings and batters tend to
          vary according to region. In Tokyo, there is a semi-liquid okonomiyaki called monjayaki. </p>

        <h4>Katsu Curry</h4>
         <p>Japanese curry (カレー karē) is one of the most popular dishes in Japan.
          It is commonly served in three main forms: curry rice (カレーライス karē raisu,
          curry over rice), curry udon (curry over noodles), and curry bread
          (a curry-filled pastry). The very common "curry rice" is most commonly
          referred to simply as "curry" (カレー karē).</p>

        <h4>Ramen</h4>
         <p>Ramen (拉麺, ラーメン rāmen,) is a Japanese dish with a translation of "pulled noodles".
          It consists of Chinese wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth,
          often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as
          sliced pork (叉焼 chāshū), nori (dried seaweed), menma, and scallions.
          Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen,
          such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso ramen of Hokkaido.</p>
