        <h4>Tokyo Train</h4>
        <div class="contentfill">
          Trains in this city are very sophisticated and have many categories. 
          The officers in this city are very punctual,
          there are so many types of trains in this city,
          You should try Shinkasen which is the fastest train in this city

        <h4>Tokyo Bus</h4>
        <div class="contentfill">
          Japan may be known as one of the countries with the most 
          complicated railroad and subway networks in the world.
          Trains and subways have become a mainstay of transportation 
          for Japanese residents and tourists traveling to Japan. 
          However, it should also be noted that if the bus plays 
          an important role in the mode of transportation in Japan. 
          Buses reach places that cannot be reached by trains and subways, 
          buses are the main mode of transportation to beat trains and subways.

        <h4>Tokyo Taxi</h4>
        <div class="contentfill">
          Taxis in Japan look almost the same as taxis in other countries, 
          with sedan type cars with two rows of seats complete with 
          empty indicator lights or filled above the cab's body. 
          All taxis in Japan are also equipped with GPS and taximeter, 
          so it is not possible to be cheated by taxi drivers like in other countries. 
          However, taking a taxi in a big city in Japan is 
          something we should avoid while we can. 
          Aside from the busy city streets, taxi fares in Japan 
          are one of the most expensive in the world.

        <h4>Tokyo Bike Center</h4>
        <div class="contentfill">
          Various tourist areas in Tokyo such as Ginza, 
          Tsukiji and Odaiba are located close to one another. 
          Therefore, compared to using the train, it will be more 
          efficient if you surround these areas by bicycle. 
          To get around Tokyo by bicycle, you can take advantage of 
          the bike share service. Bike share is a bicycle rental service 
          where you can freely use bicycles that are placed at certain 
          points (bicycle parking) in the city.
